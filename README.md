This is a plugin to selectively remove part sof the library for my theme [_Second Foundation](https://github.com/Shelob9/_second_foundation).

Most of the magic happens by adding files to the array $removes that are added in the parent theme's [functions.php](https://github.com/Shelob9/_second_foundation/blob/master/functions.php).

It can also selectively remove actions that add scripts/styles in parent theme, and disable all fo the parent theme's customizer stuff.
